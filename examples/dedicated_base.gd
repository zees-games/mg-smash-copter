## [b]The one line that leaked mg-buses-from-hell's whole script graph at exit.[/b]
##
## A script that `extends DotNetMessage` and preloads ITSELF, first loaded from a module a
## running [DotServer] loads — which is how every deployed server loads this game — leaves
## every loaded script alive at exit on Godot 4.7.2 (measured in mg-buses-from-hell,
## 8ed866c). This game's event and request both did it, for a typed `of()` factory.
##
## [b]Asserted on the source, because the symptom is where no check can reach.[/b] The
## leak is reported after `quit()`, by the engine, as warnings a CI filter already treats
## as noise; an assertion here runs before any of it exists. So this checks the cause
## instead: every message script in `game/`, read as text.

## Runs this same suite in a fresh process: `[exit code, its stdout, its stderr, whether it
## had to be killed, the seconds it was allowed]`.
##
## [b]A leak is reported after `quit()`, by the engine, where nothing in the process that
## leaked can read it.[/b] "N ObjectDB instances were leaked at exit" is printed once the
## scene tree is gone, so the only process that can check a run's exit is another one. On
## Godot 4.7.2 a script that names itself, loaded after its base, cuts the engine's exit
## teardown short and every script loaded before it is reported leaked — hundreds of lines
## a passing run printed for weeks, which is why this is a check now and not a warning.
##
## [b]First, before this run opens a port[/b], so the two never contend for a socket — and
## so this run is always the second one against the same `user://`, which is the other
## thing no single run can see.
##
## [b]Not `OS.execute`.[/b] That blocks until the copy exits, so a copy that hangs held this
## run for ever; and when the outer `timeout` then killed this run, the copy was left behind
## holding the suite's directory and port. So the copy is started, polled against a deadline
## and killed at it. Two deadlines, because Godot dies on SIGTERM without running a line of
## script — nothing in this process can clean up after it is killed:
##
## - coreutils `timeout` wraps the copy where it exists. It is an exec wrapper, not a shell,
##   and it outlives this process, so a copy orphaned by the outer `timeout` still dies on
##   time. Its exit status 124 is how its expiry is recognised.
## - this loop's own deadline, a little later, for a platform without it.
##
## `execute_with_pipe` rather than `create_process`, because the latter captures nothing and
## the whole point is reading what the copy printed. Non-blocking, and drained on every pass
## rather than once at the end: a pipe holds 64 KiB, and a copy that fills it blocks on its
## next print — a hang this probe would then report as the suite's own. The copy's stdin is
## the other end of a pipe this process holds open, which is why every suite turns the
## server's stdin console off: a reader blocked on it never lets the copy exit.
